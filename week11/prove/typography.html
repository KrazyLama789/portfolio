        For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect amortization program and you want to install it
        on
        the
        workgroup server for other systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party or custom
        application,
        the
        logical place for it is in /usr/local/appname, possibly with a link to the program binary in the /usr/local/bin
        directory (because that's in the path).

            If given a choice between putting the software package <span class="bold caps">bigprog</span> in the <span
                class="bold">/usr/local/<span class="caps">bigprog</span></span> section and the
            <span class="bold">/opt/<span class="caps">bigprog</span></span>
            section, it's hard to choose. Read any relevant exam question closely--the main difference being that the
            /opt section
            is not considered to be sharable, whereas the <span class="bold">/usr</span> section is often shared and mounted by client systems.

    <h2>
        File Management Commands
    </h2>

    <p>
        A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands properly with the right options and
        arguments.
        As a
        good sysadmin, you'll be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on, display, move, copy,
        and
        determine the type of files and programs.

            You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of possibilities, type in appropriate

        Tips for working with Linux files
    </h3>
    <p>

        Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, a quick set of recommendations for
        the
        less-experienced can be of help here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Hidden files aren't really hidden —</span>They just begin with a ., such as the .bashrc
            and .bash_profile
            files.
            These
            are
            not viewable by normal users with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by commands such as
            rm -f
            *.*.

        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters —</span>
            The filenames this.is.a.long.file and
            thisisalongfile
            are perfectly reasonable and possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type —</span>
            Use an _ or a - instead of spaces because it's
            neater and
            easier than prefixing all spaces with a \. (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space
            prefixes with
            a
            backslash.)
        </li>
    </ul>
